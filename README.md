## Solution

We have developed an approach to dynamically generate the family tree:

* Query the electoral search website with user's details.
* Get the user's polling booth from the details.
* Download the electoral roll PDF for that booth from the website of that state's Chief Electoral Officer.
* Since the PDFs contain the electoral roll as image data, we use Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract the text from the PDF.
* This text is parsed to generate a JSON file with all the people's details, which are cached in the local filesystem for faster access.
* This JSON file is then used to generate the family tree of a person or a constituency.
* The family trees are generated by finding ancestors and spouses from this data for people belonging to the same house.
* The trees can be visualised using our web application.
