Submission for TransfiNITTe'22 hackathon under the problem statement "Family Tree" by BharatX

## Problem Statement

Creatre a Family Tree of all families in India (Pan India) using Electoral Roll Pdf available at nsvp.in. You are free to use any technology or any hack to crack the problem statement.

## Solution

We have developed an approach to dynamically generate the family tree:

* Query the electoral search website with user's details.
* Get the user's polling booth from the details.
* Download the electoral roll PDF for that booth from the website of that state's Chief Electoral Officer.
* Since the PDFs contain the electoral roll as image data, we use Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract the text from the PDF.
* This text is parsed to generate a JSON file with all the people's details, which are cached in the local filesystem for faster access.
* This JSON file is then used to generate the family tree of a person or a constituency.
* The family trees are generated by finding ancestors and spouses from this data for people belonging to the same house.
* The trees can be visualised using our web application.
